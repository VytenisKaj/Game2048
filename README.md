Game "2048" created by Vytenis Kajackas

NOTE:

1) This is not a complete copy, though reference should be made to the original creators ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)")
2) Not all features had been added that I wanted (reset button, power-ups, possibly will come later) due to lack of time and other work.
3) Due to game being new, you may experience bugs or even crashes (possibly fixed, but who knows, coding is hard and C++ shenanigans do not make it easier).
   If you encounter any of them, I would be thankful if you could report them to me (how the board looked, what you did, what happened exactly etc.). FB: Vytenis Kajackas


If you wish to try the game for yourself:

1) Download "game2048.exe" and ALL *.png files. You can find them in "exe" directory of this repository. (You may need to disable antivirus and/or press "keep" at a pop-up).
2) Put all of the contents in directory of your choice.
  (Add arrow_up, arrow_down etc. *.png files TO THE EXACTLY SAME DIRECTORY AS "game2048.exe" file. "git.keep" can be ignored).
3) Launch the game.

NOTE that this method will only work on some systems (64-bit Windows 10, maybe some others).


If you wish to compile it for yourself:

1) If you do not have wxWidgets ("https://www.wxwidgets.org/"), install it ( This is most likely not an option for most people, because it takes ~20 mins)
  (If you want to install wxWidgets anyways, I suggest following this video: "https://youtu.be/FOIbK4bJKS8")
2) Create a Visual studio (VS for short) project ("https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/").
3) Put all of the contents from src directory of this repository into your VS project directory.
4) Add all files to the project.
5) Compile.
